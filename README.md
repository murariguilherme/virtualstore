# virtualstore4

This is a virtual store, it seems like a Microservice application but not.
Each project has their own API and shared files in common with building blocks (Core application).

The objective in this application is to create a project that simulate a microservice project, using message bus (RabbitMQ) to communication between endpoints.

Hope you enjoy!
